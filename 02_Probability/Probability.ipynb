    "## 📘 1. Probability Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution describes how probabilities are assigned to different possible values of a random variable.\n",
    "It shows:\n",
    ">What values the variable can take\n",
    ">How likely each value is\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Types of Probability Distributions\n",
    "A. Discrete Probability Distribution\n",
    "Used when the variable takes countable values.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Number of customers entering a shop\n",
    "Number of defects in 50 products\n",
    "Flipping a coin\n",
    "\n",
    "#Common discrete distributions:\n",
    ">Binomial Distribution – number of successes in fixed trials\n",
    ">Poisson Distribution – number of events in a fixed time/space\n",
    ">Geometric Distribution – trials until the first success\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Continuous Probability Distribution\n",
    "Used when the variable takes infinite real values.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Height\n",
    "Weight\n",
    "Salary\n",
    "Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "#Common continuous distributions:\n",
    ">Normal Distribution – most natural data follows a bell-shaped curve\n",
    ">Uniform Distribution – equal probability for all values\n",
    ">Exponential Distribution – time between events\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Why Probability Distributions Matter\n",
    "> data patterns\n",
    ">Select correct statistical tests\n",
    ">Model uncertainty\n",
    ">Analyze behavior of random variables\n",
    ">Assist in real-world decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 2. Estimation \n",
    "Estimation is the process of using sample data to estimate population parameters.\n",
    "📌 A. Point Estimation\n",
    "Produces a single value to estimate a population parameter.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    ">Sample mean estimates population mean\n",
    ">Sample variance estimates population variance\n",
    "📌 B. Interval Estimation (Confidence Intervals)\n",
    "Provides a range within which the true population parameter is likely to lie.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "“Mean salary is 45k ± 3k at 95% confidence level.”\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Why Estimation is Important\n",
    ">Measures sampling uncertainty\n",
    ">Used in hypothesis testing\n",
    ">Important for forecasting\n",
    ">Helps in decision-making with incomplete information\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 3. Conditional Probability \n",
    "Conditional probability measures the probability of an event given that another event has already occurred.\n",
    "Formula: P(A|B)=p(AnB)/P(B)\n",
    "📌 Example\n",
    ">Probability a customer buys a phone given they clicked the product page.\n",
    ">Probability of rain given that humidity is high.\n",
    "📌 Uses\n",
    ">Customer behavior analysis\n",
    ">Recommendation systems\n",
    ">Medical diagnosis\n",
    ">Risk analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 4. Bayes Probability (Bayes Theorem)\n",
    "Bayes theorem allows updating an earlier belief (prior probability) when new information becomes available.\n",
    "Formula: P(A|B)=(P(B|A) *P(A))/P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    " 📌 Terminology\n",
    "P(A) → Prior probability\n",
    "P(B|A) → Likelihood\n",
    "P(A|B) → Posterior probability (updated probability)\n",
    "P(B) → Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    " 📌 Real-Life Use Cases\n",
    ">Spam detection\n",
    ">Medical test accuracy\n",
    ">Fraud prediction\n",
    ">Weather forecasting\n",
    ">Naive Bayes classifier (Machine Learning)"
